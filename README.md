# JokerBot
A Discord bot that fetches jokes using the Nerd Jokes API written in Go

## About
This is a very simple Discord bot which works in tandem with my [Nerd Jokes API](https://github.com/ADawesomeguy/nerd-jokes-api). It's part of my first project in learning golang and uses the language bindings for the Discord API provided by [discordgo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo).

## Usage
To use the bot, just clone the repository and run `go run main.go [BOT TOKEN]`. To compile it as a binary (recommended for production), run `go build main.go`, and then run it as `./main [BOT TOKEN]`.
